Requirements for setting up the web site:

Various perl libraries: CGI, DBI, File::stat, HTTP::Request,
IO::Handle, JSON, LWP::Simple, LWP::UserAgent, Digest::MD5,
Time::HiRes, URI::Escape, XML::LibXML

sqlite3 must be installed

bin/ cgi/ lib/ static/ should match the code repository

The tmp/ subdirectory should be writable by the web server

The data/ subdirectory should contain the uniq.faa BLAST database, the
litsearch.db sqlite3 database, and stats. These files are built by the
PaperBLAST pipeline (and more specifically by the last step,
run_final.pl) into work/data. They will need to be moved to where the
CGI scripts can see them.

The bin/blast directory should contain various BLAST executables
(including fastacmd, bl2seq, and blastall).

For genomeSearch.cgi to work also requires a usearch executable to be
in bin/usearch.  Version 10.0 (32-bit) has been tested; later versions
will probably work as well.

For hmmSearch.cgi to work also requires static/pfam and
static/tigrfam:

static/pfam should contain PFam models, i.e. PF00001.21.hmm
(These can be built from Pfam-A.hmm by using hmmfetch.)

static/tigrfam should contain TIGRFam models,
i.e. tigrfam/TIGR00001.hmm

For vspdb.cgi to work also requires vspdb/unhit.tsv (which does not
have a clean pipeline yet, but is available in the code repository)

Optionally, use motd to show a "message of the day" at the top of the
main page and some other pages.
