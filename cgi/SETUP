Requirements for setting up the web site:

bin/ cgi/ lib/ static/ to match the code repository

A tmp/ subdirectory that is writable by the web server

Optionally, motd to show a "message of the day" at the top of the main page.

For hmmSearch.cgi to work also requires

static/pfam to contain PFam models, i.e. PF00001.21.hmm

static/tigrfam to contain TIGRFam models, i.e. tigrfam/TIGR00001.hmm
