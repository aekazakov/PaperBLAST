# MetaCyc only lists one pathway for tryptophan biosynthesis,
# from chorismate, glutamine, 5-phosphoribose-1-diphosphate, and serine

# These are also referred to as alpha/beta or component 1/2 or I/II
# Note that E. coli TrpD is fused to anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase
# but that is described separately.
# Note that some related proteins have EC 2.6.1.85 which should perhaps be ignored
# BT0532 (Q8AAD3_BACTN) and CA265_RS22890 (A0A1X9ZB07_9SPHI) are also component I
# Similarly for DVU0465 (Q72EV3_DESVH) and DvMF_1746 (B8DM47_DESVM)
