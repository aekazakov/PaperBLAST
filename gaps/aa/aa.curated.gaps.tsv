Azospirillum brasilense Sp245	5488	FitnessBrowser	azobra	his	hisD	spurious	An frameshift error in the genome sequence prevented this protein from being predicted (PMID:29324779)
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482	4816	FitnessBrowser	Btheta	thr	thrB	novel	This genome does not encode a standard homoserine kinase, but does encode a standard threonine synthase (BT2401). BT2402 is related to phosphoglycerate mutases and is proposed to move phosphate groups to homoserine based on conserved gene order (see TIGR02535). Indeed, BT2402 is required for growth in minimal media unless threonine is provided. However, BT2402 did not complement a thrB- strain of E. coli (Hualan Liu, personal communication). Insertions in BT2402 could be polar on the threonine synthase (which is downstream), but insertions in either orientation seem deficient in growth in minimal media. Overall, the role of BT2402 remains uncertain.
Echinicola vietnamensis KMM 6221, DSM 17526	4625	FitnessBrowser	Cola	lys		novel	This organism probably uses succinylated intermediates, as Echvi_3551 is a good candidate for the succinyltransferase DapD. But the aminotransferase and the desuccinylase cannot be found. Alternatively, Echvi_0124 could be a diverged diamopimelate aminotransferase.
Echinicola vietnamensis KMM 6221, DSM 17526	4625	FitnessBrowser	Cola	ser	serC	diverged	Echvi_1811 could be a diverged phosphoserine aminotransferase. It appears to be essential (PMID:29769716)
Echinicola vietnamensis KMM 6221, DSM 17526	4625	FitnessBrowser	Cola	chorismate	aroA	diverged	Echvi_0122 may be a diverged 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyl transferase (also known as 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase). It appears to be essential (PMID:29769716)
Echinicola vietnamensis KMM 6221, DSM 17526	4625	FitnessBrowser	Cola	cys	cysE	diverged	Echvi_0221 may be a diverged serine acetyltransferase. It appears to be essential (PMID:29769716).
Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL-12	4192	FitnessBrowser	Dino	thr	thrB	novel	This genome does not encode a standard homoserine kinase, but does encode a standard threonine synthase (Dshi_1146).
Dyella japonica UNC79MFTsu3.2	4330	FitnessBrowser	Dyella79	ser	serB	novel	This genome has several weak candidates for phosphoserine phosphatase.
Dyella japonica UNC79MFTsu3.2	4330	FitnessBrowser	Dyella79	ile	ilvI	diverged	This genome and others of its species (Dyella japonica) have a short IlvI (regulatory subunit of acetolactate synthase), i.e. N515DRAFT_0566. The conservation suggests that it is functional.
Dyella japonica UNC79MFTsu3.2	4330	FitnessBrowser	Dyella79	leu	ilvI	diverged	This genome and others of its species (Dyella japonica) have a short IlvI (regulatory subunit of acetolactate synthase), i.e. N515DRAFT_0566. The conservation suggests that it is functional.
Dyella japonica UNC79MFTsu3.2	4330	FitnessBrowser	Dyella79	met	metC	diverged	This organism probably uses the transsulfuration pathway (MetB = N515DRAFT_4363 is important for growth in minimal media). N515DRAFT_4305 is likely to be cystathionine beta-lyase (MetC), but it is also very similar to a characterized cystathionine gamma-lyase (Q5H4T8), so we cannot be confident.

Shewanella oneidensis MR-1	4467	FitnessBrowser	MR1	chorismate	aroC	spurious	The chorismate synthase appears to be truncated or split into two reading frames (SO3078.2 and SO_3079). Inspection of sequencing data (from TnSeq) shows that this frameshift is an error in the original genome sequence.

Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942	2669	FitnessBrowser	SynE	his	hisN	novel	Synpcc7942_1763 could be a diverged histidinol-phosphate phosphatase, but it is not required for growth.
