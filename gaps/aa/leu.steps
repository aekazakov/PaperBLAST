# MetaCyc only lists one pathway, which begins with the initial steps of
# valine biosynthesis, from 2 pyruvate to acetolactate, 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate,
# and 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, catalyzed by ilvHICD

# ilvIH (or ilvGM) is a two-subunit enzyme that forms acetolactate or acetohydroxybutanoate
# BRENDA often annotates both subunits the same, so it is unclear which is which
# CH_124129 and CH_123884 are probably correct but have limited data and vaguer annotations
