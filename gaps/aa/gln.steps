# Glutamine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# L-glutamine biosynthesis I from glutamine (metacyc:GLNSYN-PWY)
# or glutaminyl-tRNA(Gln) biosynthesis via transamidation (metacyc:PWY-5921).
# Both of these pathways require glutamate. The biosynthesis of glutamate
# is not represented in GapMind, as glutamate can be formed by transamination of alpha-ketoglutarate,
# an interemdiate in the TCA cycle.

# A protein from Cupriavidus necator is reported to be a 3-hydroxylaminophenol mutase (see Swiss-Prot 3HAPM_CUPNJ),
# involved in 3-nitrophenol degradation. That is the only glutamine synthetase-like protein
# in the proteome of Cupriavidus necator (strain JMP 134 / LMG 1197) [see proteome UP000002697]
# and is 96% identical to the essential protein RR42_RS12995 from Cupriavidus basilensis 4G11.
# It is probably a glutamine synthetase.
# SYNPCC7942_2156-MONOMER is annotated with the same reaction, but was not originally given this EC number.

# Glutamyl-tRNA(Glu/Gln) is usually formed by a nondescriminating glutamyl-tRNA synthetase.
# CCNA_01982 (uniprot:A0A0H3C8P5_CAUVN) from Caulobacter crescentus is the sole glutamyl-tRNA
# synthetase, there is no glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, and gatABC are present,
# so we annotated it as non-discriminating. In contrast, as of March 2019, unirule
# UR000075658 labeled it as EC:6.1.1.17 (the discriminating kind).

# The amidotransferase often acts on both glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) and aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) --
# do not try to distinguish.
# Note there are no hits for some of these terms -- for some reason only gatB is annotated as a
# aspartyl/glutamyl-tRNA(Asn/Gln) amidotransferase subunit
# Need to flag the metacyc entries separately because they have HTML tags in their descriptions
