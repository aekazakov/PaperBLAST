# MetaCyc lists just one pathway for valine biosynthesis

# ilvIH (or ilvGM) is a two-subunit enzyme that forms acetolactate or acetohydroxybutanoate
# BRENDA often annotates both subunits the same, so it is unclear which is which
# CH_124129 and CH_123884 are probably correct but have limited data and vaguer annotations
