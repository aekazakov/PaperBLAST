# MetaCyc tyrosine biosynthesis I

# Chorismate mutase is often fused, which
# makes it difficult to find this activity when it is fused to something else. 
# As of March 2019, the PFam does not have any characterized members with other functions

# prephenate dehydrogenase and arogenate dehydrogenase are difficult to distinguish
# 1.3.1.12 and 1.3.1.13 vary by NAD(P)H cofactor
# BT3933 (Q8A0T8_BACTN), DVU0464 (Q72EV4_DESVH), HSERO_RS18425 (D8IR44_HERSS), and Ga0059261_2298 (A0A1L6J750) are auxotrophic
# and have prephenate dehydrogenase domains (PF02153), but their specificity is unclear

# tyrosine biosynthesis III is like I but with NADH as the cofactor for the dehydrogenase
# (EC 1.3.1.43), so is included above

# tyrosine biosynthesis IV starts from phenylalanine; it appears that Dyella japonica uses this
# gene (N515DRAFT_3052) to make tyrosine, as it has auxotrophic phenotypes.
# This enzyme requires oxygen
