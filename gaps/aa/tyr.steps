# Tyrosine biosynthesis in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# L-tyrosine biosynthesis I via 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate (metacyc:TYRSYN),
# pathway II via L-arogenate (metacyc:PWY-3461),
# pathway III via L-arogenate (metacyc:PWY-6120),
# or pathway IV via phenylalanine (metacyc:PWY-6134).
# Pathway II and III are identical except that different cofactors are used by
# L-arogenate dehydrogenase; these are not distinguished in GapMind.
# Pathways I and II/III both involve prephenate; in pathway I, prephenate is
# oxidized to hydroxyphenylpyruvate before being aminated, while in II/III, prephenate
# is aminated to arogenate before being oxidized to tyrosine.
# These alternatives are difficult to distinguish by sequence analysis.
# MetaCyc describes pathway IV as occuring in metazoa, but it
# also seems to be the main path to tyrosine in some aerobic bacteria
# (PMC7311316).

# MetaCyc tyrosine biosynthesis I

# Chorismate mutase is often fused, which
# makes it difficult to find this activity when it is fused to something else. 
# As of March 2019, the PFam does not have any characterized members with other functions

# prephenate dehydrogenase and arogenate dehydrogenase are difficult to distinguish.

# HVO_1312 (uniprot:D4GXG3) is auxotrophic for tyrosine and is probably a prephenate dehydrogenase (PMC4300041).
