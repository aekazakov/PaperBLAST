# MetaCyc pathway I

# Chorismate mutase is usually fused to prephenate dehydratase, which
# makes it difficult to find this activity when it is fused to something else. 
# As of March 2019, the PFam does not have any characterized members with other functions
cmutase	chorismate mutase	EC:5.4.99.5	hmm:PF01817

# prephenate dehydratase and arogenate dehydratase can be difficult to distinguish
# BT3936 is diverged but has auxotrophic phenotypes (as do homologs Echvi_0123, CA265_RS11630)
pdehyd	prephenate dehydratase	EC:4.2.1.51	uniprot:Q8A0T5_BACTN	ignore_other:EC 4.2.1.91

ilvE	phenylalanine transaminase	EC:2.6.1.1	EC:2.6.1.27	EC:2.6.1.57

# MetaCyc pathway II uses chorismate mutase but then continues with

ptransferase	prephenate aminotransferase	EC:2.6.1.79

adehyd	arogenate dehydratase	EC:4.2.1.91	ignore_other:EC 4.2.1.51

# MetaCyc pathway III is like pathway I but uses tyrosine instead of glutamate as the amino donor
