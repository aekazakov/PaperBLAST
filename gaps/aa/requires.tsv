cys:from_serine_homocysteine	!met:transsulfuration	Cannot make cysteine from homocysteine and also make homocysteine from cysteine.
cys:from_serine_homocysteine	met:homocysteine	Cysteine biosynthesis via reverse transsulfuration requires homocysteine. However, even organisms that require external methionine for growth can usually produce homocysteine, because homocysteine is an intermediate in the S-adenosylmethionine cycle.
