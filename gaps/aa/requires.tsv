cys:from_serine_homocysteine	!met:transsulfuration	Cannot make cysteine from homocysteine and also make homocysteine from cysteine.
cys:from_serine_homocysteine	met:homocysteine	Cysteine biosynthesis via the reverse transsulfuration pathway requires homocysteine, which is an intermediate in methionine biosynthesis. Homocysteine is also an intermediate in the S-adenosylmethionine cycle, so many organisms that cannot synthesize methionine can convert it to homocysteine.
