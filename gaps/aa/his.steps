# In Bacillus subtilis, the histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase activity is provided by a gene that is in a cluster of
# genes for tyrosine and phenylalanine biosynthesis, see PMID:4431. Homology suggests that this
# activity is provided by "HisH" (BSU22620), which indeed is just upstream of tyrA (also see PMID:6092865).
# This protein is now usually referred to as "HisC" (HIS8_BACSU)
