# Ethanol can pass through biological membranes, so no transporter is required.
# Ethanol degradation in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# ethanol degradation I (oxidation to acetyl-CoA, metacyc:ETOH-ACETYLCOA-ANA-PWY)
# and II (oxidation to acetate and activation, metacyc:PWY66-21).
# Pathways III (with ethanol monooxygenase, metacyc:PWY66-161) and
# IV (with ethanol peroxidase, metacyc:PWY66-162) are not reported to
# occur in prokaryotes and are not included.
