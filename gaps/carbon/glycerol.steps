# Glycerol utilization in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathways
# glycerol degradation I via glycerol kinase (metacyc:PWY-4261),
# II via dihydroxyacetone kinase (metacyc:PWY-6131),
# or V via dihydroxyacetone:PEP phoshpotransferase (metacyc:GLYCEROLMETAB-PWY).
# Two fermentative pathways are not included because they do not lead to
# carbon incorporation (metacyc:PWY-6130, metacyc:PWY-7003).


# MetaCyc Pathway: glycerol degradation II involves
# glycerol dehydrogenase (dhaD, 1.1.1.6) and dihydroxyacetone kinase (and tpi)


# ABC transporters:

# GlpSTPQV from Rhizobium leguminosarum
# and a related system from Acidovorax GW101-3H11.
# GlpS/GlpT are similar to each other; GlpS is more similar to Ac3H11_791 and GlpT to Ac3H11_792
