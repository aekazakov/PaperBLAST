deoP	deoxyribose transporter	uniprot:A0A5K1UX94

# EC 2.7.1.15 (ribose kinase) includes enzymes known to act on deoxyribose.

# Produces acetaldehyde and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
deoC	deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase	EC:4.1.2.4

# Oxidizes acetaldehyde to acetyl-CoA, usually with NAD+ as the electron acceptor.
# Q2XQZ7 is probably acetaldehyde dehydrogenase but is misannotated in BRENDA
# Some very similar sequences are propanal dehydrogenases (1.2.1.87)
# or butanal dehydrogenases (1.2.1.57); these sequences often act on
# acetaldehyde as well.
# Fitness data implies that BWI76_RS21985 is a broad aldehyde dehydrogenase, including activity on acetaldehyde
# (EC 1.2.1.3 also describes aldehyde dehydrogenases with broad substrate ranges;
#  not sure if those hits should be ignored or not.)
# Also, many enzymes are bifunctional alcohol/acetaldehyde dehydrogenases and these
# may be annotated as 1.1.1.1 or 1.1.1.71 only, so ignore hits to those as well.

# This three-component periplasmic (probably) dehydrogenase seems to be non-specific, but

# (Oxidative damage of DNA and archaeal glycolysis also be sources of deoxyribonate.)
