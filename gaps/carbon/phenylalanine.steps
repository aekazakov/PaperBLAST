# Phenylalanine utilization in GapMind is based on MetaCyc pathway
# L-phenylalanine degradation I (aerobic, via tyrosine, metacyc:PHENYLALANINE-DEG1-PWY),
# pathway II (anaerobic, via phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase, metacyc:ANAPHENOXI-PWY),
# degradation via phenylpyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PMC3346364),
# or degradation via phenylacetaldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PMID:24214948).
# (MetaCyc describes additional pathways, but they do not result in carbon
# incorporation or are not reported in prokaryotes, so they are not included in GapMind.)

# In E. coli, the ABC transporter livFGHMJ or livFGHMK transports phenylalanine.
# livJ and livK are alternate substrate binding proteins that are similar to each other.
#
# A related system in Pseudomonas fluorescens FW300-N2E2 is also important for phenylalanine utlization:
#   Pf6N2E2_2921 = livK = A0A160A0J6; Pf6N2E2_2923 = livH = A0A0D9B2B6; Pf6N2E2_2924 = livM = A0A159ZYE0;
#    Pf6N2E2_2925 = livG = A0A159ZWS6; Pf6N2E2_2926 = livF = A0A159ZWL6).
#
# Ignored the orthologs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (the bra system), which transports various
#   amino acids and might transport phenylalanine.
#
# A related system in Acidovorax sp. GW101-3H11 also transports phenylalanine:
#   LivF = Ac3H11_1692 (A0A165KC78), LivG = Ac3H11_1693 (A0A165KC86),
#   LivJ = Ac3H11_2396 (A0A165KTD4; not near the other components, but cofit),
#   LivH = Ac3H11_1695 (A0A165KC95), LivM = Ac3H11_1694 (A0A165KER0).
